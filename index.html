	<h1>JEROME</h1>
    <h3>Student</h3>
    <p><b><i>Hello there, I am Jerome as you may already know.</b></p>

<p>Long time ago, I was brought on to this world by my parents.</p>

<p>Under their care, I grew up. Without knowing how or why. I suppose one will always grow. Time never waits for anyone. 24 years has passed since then, Gray strains of hair can be seen from far. Bodies getting more and more out of shape. How furtile time is. Always seen to be out of our hands even if we try our best to hold onto it.</p>

<p>Right, so a little about me is that i am still trying to complete my diploma studies. However, I was actually once a student going for a diploma certificate in the building industry. But then I relaised it was not what I have envision myself be doing for my future. Hence I drop out of it. One might question why did I not just transfer to the desire course in my mind? I suppose then I am still not confident if that was the right course for me. With that in mind, I decided to give myself sometime by enlisting in the army. </p>

<p>So then before that I was a normal student with average scores, nothing really stands out. Just a pretty normal student with a pretty normal school life.</p>

<P>Perhaps I should indulge you with some of my hobbies, I think such will allow amiable discussion. Well, I enjoy reading, I am a avid sports fans, mostly with football and basketball. Oh and I have some sort a poetry account. I alway find it hilarity when I speak of my writings, as never in a million year I thought I would write, espeically if you know me long before now. 
Below are some image that seems fitting to this edeavour we are doing.
